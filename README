Then, choose ONE of these methods:

## Method 1: Using Conda Environment
```bash
# Activate the conda environment
conda activate ./env

# Run the script
python Test.py

# Deactivate the conda environment when done
conda deactivate
```

## Method 2: Using Virtual Environment (venv)
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment

```
Note: Use only one method at a time. Do not mix conda and venv commands.
